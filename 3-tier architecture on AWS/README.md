Creating a 3-tier architecture on AWS typically involves using different AWS services for each tier, such as Amazon EC2 instances for the presentation tier, Amazon RDS for the data tier, and possibly Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda for the application tier.

To set up a 3-tier architecture, you can follow these general steps:

## Presentation Tier (Web Server):
- Use Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your web application.
- Create a new EC2 instance, install a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), and deploy your web application code.

## Application Tier (Application Server):
- Deploy your application logic on another set of EC2 instances, or use AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
- If using EC2 instances, create a separate set of instances to handle the application logic. Install the necessary software and configure them to communicate with the presentation tier.

## Data Tier (Database):
- Use Amazon RDS for a managed relational database service, or Amazon DynamoDB for a NoSQL database.
- Create a database instance, configure security settings, and connect it to your application tier
